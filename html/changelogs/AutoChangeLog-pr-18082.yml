changes:
  - balance: "Existing acid puddles now delete themselves to allow for new acid puddles - this causes various abilities like Acid Dash and Acid Spray to have full effect while on existing acid puddles."
  - bugfix: "Resin facehuggers no longer infinitely stack thin resin."
  - code_imp: "The creation of acid spray puddles is now done through xenomorph_spray()."
